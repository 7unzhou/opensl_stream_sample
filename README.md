opensl_stream_sample
====================

A sample app illustrating how to use opensl_stream. In addition to the usage of the C API, it also shows how to configure OpenSL, using new API calls in Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean MR1) if possible and resorting to reasonable default values if necessary.

This sample app will work with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or later; opensl_stream itself, however, only requires Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) or later.

Make sure to clone this repository with "--recursive" to get the opensl_stream submodule.
